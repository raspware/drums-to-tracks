# Drums to Tracks!

A simple MIDI tool that extracts the drum notes and places them in their own tracks. I developed this as I tend to write my initial drums using [TuxGuitar](http://www.tuxguitar.com.ar/) with all drums on a single track. However, when importing this into my chosen DAW [Cakewalk](https://www.bandlab.com/products/cakewalk) I like to have all parts of the drums on separate tracks. So rather than manually selecting, moving, copying, pasting notes and creating loads of tracks in Cakewalk, I decided to make this tool!

## How to use

Download the contents of the `dist` folder and drag your MIDI file onto the `Raspware.DrumsToTracks.exe` file. Sit back, relax, take a sip of coffee ðŸ˜Ž. The extracted drums version of the MIDI file will be placed in the same directory as the original MIDI and will start with the text `(Drums)`.
