# Drums to Tracks!

This is a simple MIDI tool that extracts the drum notes and places them on their own track (not to mention adding a little human-touch to any drum notes that are not a snare or bass drum).

## Why?
I developed this as I tend to write my initial drums of a song using [TuxGuitar](http://www.tuxguitar.com.ar/) on a single drum track. However, when importing this into my chosen DAW ([Cakewalk](https://www.bandlab.com/products/cakewalk)) I like to have all parts of the drums separated on individual tracks (as I can then apply all kinds of effects on them individually). So, rather than manually selecting, moving, copying, pasting notes (on the piano-roll) and creating loads of tracks in Cakewalk, I decided to make a tool to do it for me!

## How to use

Download the contents of the `dist` folder and drag your MIDI file onto the `Raspware.DrumsToTracks.exe` file. Sit back, relax, take a sip of coffee ðŸ˜Ž. The extracted drums version of the MIDI file will be placed in the same directory as the original MIDI and will start with the text `(Drums)`.
